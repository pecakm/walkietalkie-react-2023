# Walkie Talkie React (2023)

Walkie Talkie prototype created with CRA, Socket.IO and Simple Peer in 2023.

There is no active demo online currently.

## Getting started

To run the project:
1. `npm ci` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to start the project

### Additional info

To connect with Socket.IO you need to run my other project: Walkie Talkie Node. Then fill the `.env` file correctly.
